mkl to fix:

18: Moving an entire column to another column disappears every card in the moved column except the bottommost one.
Reproduce: Input ‘C1->F1’, C6->C3, C2:8S->C6, C6:KH->C1, C2->F1, 		C1:KH->C2


19: Hidden cards can still be targeted and moved as long as you can guess which column they are in.

10: Using an invalid stack (C8) as argument crashes the game

17: Starting a game, returning to the menu and starting a new game adds the decks together.
	Reproduce: Input ‘P’, ‘Q’, ‘P’
